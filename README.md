# Exploring Tic-Tac-Toe variants

Things that have been done:
- setup of tictactoe abstractions, gameboards, simulation code, etc
- basic random testing + setting up baseline agents
- exploration of quick and dirty minimax agents with simple heuristics

Possible areas of exploration:
- empiraclly describing the behavior random agents in various scenarios (4x4 tic tac toe, nxn tic tac toe, perhaps with mathematical explanations after we find results)
- Trying to solve higher dimensional tic-tac-toe (compute permitting)
- Evaluating the performance of various heuristic functions
- Q-learning? (rly dont have to)
- Monte carlo tree search / minimax alternatives
